## Version 5.0:

- The add-on was rewritten from the scratch to enhance its performance, and generally to make things more easier.
- Added several new options in the Themes Manager dialogue including: 
  - The ability to run the add-on in 3D mode or Mono Mode.
  - The ability to  make NVDA ignore object role when announcing focus
  - The ability to control the volume of the add-on, either by setting the volume directly, or set it to follow the synthesizer volume.
- Audio themes now shows information about their authors, and authors can write a brief summary to describe their audio themes. Those information will be shown in the themes manager dialogue.
- Easier way to edit the current audio theme.
- Fewer steps and streamlined  process to create a new audio theme.
- The add-on can be considered a wrapper   over the Unspoken add-on which is being developed by Austin Hicks and Bryan Smart. The majority of my development went into the dialogues and audioThemeHandler modules.
