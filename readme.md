# Audio Themes Add-on For NVDA
This add-on creates a virtual audio display that plays sounds when focusing or navigating objects (such as buttons, links etc...) the audio will be played in a location that corresponds to the object's location in the visual display. The add-on also enables you to activate, install, remove, edit, create, and distribute audio theme packages.


## Usage
This add-on gives  you the ability to perform the following tasks: managing your installed audio themes, editing any of the installed audio themes and creating a new audio theme.

Although this add-on was started as an independent project, it evolved to be an enhanced version of the 'Unspoken' add-on by Austin Hicks (camlorn38@gmail.com) and Bryan Smart (bryansmart@bryansmart.com). The majority of this add-on's development went into creating the tools to manage, edit and create audio theme packages. So a big thank you to them for creating such a wonderful add-on, and making it available for us to build on top of their work.


## A Note on Third-party audio files:
The **Default** audio theme package in this add-on uses sounds from several sources, here is a breakdown for them:
- Unspoken 3D Audio: An add-on for NVDA
- TWBlue: A free and open source twitter client
- Mushy TalkBack: An alternative talkback with better sounds.
